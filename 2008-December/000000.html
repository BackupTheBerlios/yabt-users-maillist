<PRE>===================
YABT-2.0b2Update1 released
===================

YABT-2.0b2Update1 has been released and is now available on the python 
package index at <A HREF="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/YABT.">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/YABT.</A> This is only an 
update release which means that YABT has not changed in its API, only 
bug fixes and very minor alterations have been made. Alterations include:
* The YABT_translate script has been renamed to yabt-trans
* The yabt-trans script has gained a -o option to optionally output to a 
file (previously only possible by redirection in the past).
* yabt-trans can accept input from standard input, so now yabt-trans can 
be used within a pipe (for both input and output). This feature works by 
file, so the end of file sequence needs to be given before translation 
will start, this shouldn't affect piping or redirection, keyboard input 
would be the only situation where this may be noticed.

What is YABT
============

YABT originally was developed as a context sensetive Braille trnslation 
system, but the code so general, particularly
with this release, that it is now being just classified as a context 
sensetive string manipulation tool. YABT comes with
a rule implementation which uses a finite state machine and context 
matching and a Braille translation table for text to
British Braille.

YABT looks to be as useful as possible to developers, so if you find 
bugs or just have comments for how it could be
improved then please don't hesitate to provide feedback.
